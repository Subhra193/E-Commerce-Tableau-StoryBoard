# E-Commerce-Tableau-StoryBoard
A comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of all the aspects, allowing stakeholders to interact with the data, delve deeper into each area, and make informed decisions.

**Problem Statement -** <br>
As a rapidly growing e-commerce business, we are dealing with increasing volumes of sales data generated daily. With a diverse range of products spread across multiple categories, understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and the impact of various factors on sales becomes critical. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights from this complex and vast data to drive strategic business decisions.

Key questions include understanding which products or categories are top-performing, how sales vary by geography and season, and what times of day see peak sales. We also need to identify our top customers, understand sales growth year-over-year, and determine the average order value. Moreover, it's important to understand the sales distribution by region, the rate of new customer acquisition, and customer retention rate.

In addition, the impact of various factors on sales, such as product return rates and the effect of discounts on sales, needs to be assessed. Sales forecasting for the upcoming quarter is also crucial for inventory management and marketing planning. The correlation between website traffic and sales will provide insights into online customer behavior, and an understanding of the distribution of customer lifetime value will inform customer segmentation strategies.

**Objective -** <br>
The task is to leverage the power of data visualization tools like Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of all these aspects, allowing stakeholders to interact with the data, delve deeper into each area, and make informed decisions. The ultimate goal is to increase sales, improve customer retention, and optimize operations for profitability."
